cell-ref
========

This crate provides a [`Cell`] type (like the standard libraryâ€™s
[`Cell`][std-cell]) with methods for safely mutating and inspecting the
inner value by reference ([`with`] and [`with_mut`]).

For [`Copy`] types, this is implemented with [`get`][std-get] and
[`set`][std-set], but [through an extension trait][cell-ext], this crate
provides those same operations for types that are [`Default`] but not
[`Copy`]. A [`get`] method is also available for types that are both
[`Default`] and [`Clone`].
